# Plagiarism Checker Using Text Similarity
This project detects plagiarism by comparing the similarity between two text files. It calculates a similarity ratio between the contents of the files, reads the text from both documents, and determines how closely they match. The resulting similarity percentage is then printed, providing an easy way to assess textual similarity. This tool is useful for identifying potential plagiarism or content duplication, helping to verify the originality of documents effectively.
